# a little ES6 mock library testing compilation and publishing

(mostly for myself)

`npm run date` – outputs date
`npm run date-log` – appends date to `buildlog.txt` (great to see, what glue thing happens around on _being_ installed)

`npm run build:babel` – very simple output building (ES2015) to `lib/`, includes source maps

`npm run build-and-run` – convenience. „runs“ the `node lib/index.js` which has a little test code
